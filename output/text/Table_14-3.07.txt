ADAS Cog (11) - Change from Baseline to Week 24 - Completers at Wk 24-Observed Cases-Windowed 
 
 
[1] Based on Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with treatment and site group as factors and baseline 
value as a covariate. 
[2] Test for a non-zero coefficient for treatment (dose) as a continuous variable. 
[3] Pairwise comparison with treatment as a categorical variable: p-values without adjustment for multiple 
comparisons. 
Note that only assessments falling within the assessment window are included in the summary for a visit.
