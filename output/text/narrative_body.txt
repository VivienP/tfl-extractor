Criteria for Evaluation: 
Primary Efficacy Endpoints:
x Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale, total of 11 items
[ADAS-Cog (11)] at Week 24 
x Video-referenced Clinician’s Interview-based Impression of Change (CIBIC+) at 
Week 24 
Secondary Efficacy Endpoints: 
x ADAS-Cog (11) at Weeks 8 and 16 
x CIBIC+ at Weeks 8 and 16 
x Mean Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) from Week 4 to Week 24 
Safety Endpoints: 
x Adverse events 
x Vital signs (weight, standing and supine blood pressure, heart rate) 
x Laboratory evaluations 
Statistical Methods: 
Unless otherwise noted, hypothesis testing was evaluated at a significance level of 0.05.
Summary statistics for continuous variables included the number of observations, mean, 
standard deviation (SD), median, minimum, and maximum.  Summary statistics for the 
categorical variables included frequency and percentage. 
The number of subjects randomized, the number of subjects in each analysis dataset, and 
the disposition of subjects were tabulated by treatment group.  Specific reasons for early 
study discontinuation (protocol completed, lack of efficacy, and adverse event) were 
compared using a Fisher’s exact test.
The baseline characteristics were summarized by treatment group and across all 
treatment groups.  The treatment groups were compared by analysis of variance 
(ANOVA) for continuous variables and by Pearson’s chi-square test for categorical 
variables.
The primary analysis of the ADAS-Cog (11) or CIBIC+ at Week 24 used the efficacy 
population with LOCF imputation for any missing values at Week 24.  For ADAS-Cog 
(11), an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model was used to test for dose response 
with the baseline score, site, and treatment included as independent variables.  A

supportive analysis for the ADAS-Cog (11) used a likelihood-based repeated measures
(MMRM) analysis.  For CIBIC+, an ANOVA model was used to test for dose response 
with site and treatment included as independent variables.  Similar analyses were 
performed at Weeks 8 and 16 for ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+.  Summary statistics for 
ADAS-Cog (11) were also generated for each visit using the efficacy population with 
LOCF imputation.
The primary analysis of mean NPI-X total score from Week 4 to Week 24 used the 
efficacy population.  For this endpoint, an ANCOVA model was used to test for dose 
response with the baseline score, site, and treatment included as independent variables. 
Average daily dose and cumulative dose at end of study was computed for each subject
based on the planned dose and the actual number of days in the study and was 
summarized for each treatment group. 
Treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events were summarized by 
system organ class (SOC) and preferred term (PT).  The incidence of treatment
emergent events grouped under preferred terms for each active treatment were compared
to placebo using Fisher’s exact test.  Additional analysis of dermatological adverse 
events was conducted.  The time to the first dermatological event was compared across 
the treatment groups using Kaplan-Meier methods.
Hematology and clinical chemistry values were summarized at each visit week.  The 
number of subjects with no abnormal measure during treatment and those with at least 
one abnormal measure during treatment were summarized for each lab analyte.  Fisher’s 
exact test was used to analyze the incidence of abnormal (high or low) measures during 
the post-randomization phase.  A display summarizing shifts from baseline by week in 
terms of abnormality based on threshold range was provided.  The data were 
summarized comparing baseline and on drug categorization for each treatment group for 
each week for each laboratory analyte.  Shift tables summarizing whether a subject’s 
status changed from baseline during the treatment period were provided for changes 
based on threshold ranges and changes based on Hy’s Law.  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel 
(CMH) tests, stratifying by status at baseline, were performed.
Vital sign data and weight were summarized by treatment group.  The number and 
percent of subjects receiving each concomitant medication were summarized.
Summary of Results:
Disposition:
A total of 254 subjects were randomized and entered the double-blind treatment phase.
The number of subjects randomized to each treatment arm was: 86 to placebo, 84 to the 
xanomeline low dose treatment group and 84 to the xanomeline high dose treatment
group.  Of the 254 subjects randomized to treatment, 118 completed the treatment phase 
(Week 24), and 110 completed the study through Week 26.  A statistically significantly

(p < 0.0001) higher number of subjects in the xanomeline low dose and high dose 
groups (67% and 64%, respectively) prematurely discontinued from the study prior to 
Week 24 as compared to the placebo group (30%).  The most common reason for 
discontinuation was adverse event (9% placebo subjects, 52% xanomeline low dose 
subjects, 46% xanomeline high dose subjects), with a statistically significant association 
between discontinuation due to adverse event and treatment group (p < 0.0001). 
Efficacy Results: 
A statistically significant dose response was not seen for either of the primary efficacy 
endpoints, changes from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 and CIBIC+ at week 
24.  Adjusted means for these 2 endpoints were similar for all 3 treatment groups.
Additional analyses at earlier time points showed similar results.  Subgroup analyses by 
gender, a sensitivity analysis for missing data, and a repeated measures analysis for
ADAS-Cog (11) also indicated lack of treatment response.  The secondary efficacy 
endpoint of the mean NPI-X values from Week 4 through Week 24 also did not 
demonstrate a statistically significant dose response. 
Safety Results:
Over 90% of subjects receiving active therapy reported at least 1 adverse event 
compared to 75.6% of subjects receiving placebo.  This difference is due largely to a 
disproportionate number of dermatologic type events that occurred in the xanomeline
treatment groups.  Approximately 73% of the subjects in either of the xanomeline
groups experienced at least one dermatologic adverse event of interest compared to 
33.6% of the placebo subjects.  There was a statistically significant difference 
(p < 0.001) in the time to first dermatologic event between the treatment groups.  There 
were 3 deaths (2 in placebo group, 1 in the xanomeline low dose group) observed during 
the study.  None of the deaths were judged related to treatment.  Aside from the deaths, 
there were 3 serious adverse events reported in 3 subjects (2 in xanomeline high dose 
and 1 in the xanomeline low dose group) and all were related to the nervous system.
The association between treatment group and the number of abnormal values beyond the 
normal range was significant for three laboratory analytes: albumin (p = 0.042), urea 
nitrogen (p = 0.023), and eosinophils (p = 0.001).  The association between clinically 
significant changes from the previous visit and treatment was statistically significant for 
aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.045) and eosinophils (p = 0.010).  The analysis of 
shifts from baseline to most abnormal value could not be calculated on 19 of the 
analytes.  Of the remaining 11 analytes, only eosinophils showed a statistically 
significant association with treatment group (p = 0.044).  There was no significant 
association with treatment group in the Hy’s law analyses examining shifts in 
transaminase levels, and transaminase and total bilirubin levels between baseline values 
and values while on treatment.
Changes from baseline in vital signs (SBP, DBP, and pulse), at the Week 24 and end of 
treatment assessments, were generally small decreases.  Changes from baseline in

weight, at the Week 24 and end of treatment assessments, however, were generally 
small with no treatment-related pattern of increases or decreases.
Conclusions:
A statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects in the active treatment groups 
withdrew prematurely from the study as compared to the placebo group.  This is largely 
due to the higher proportion of subjects in the active treatment groups experiencing a 
dermatologic event and subsequently resulting in premature withdrawal from the study.
This further hindered the study’s ability to demonstrate efficacy. 
A statistically significant dose response was not seen for both of the primary efficacy 
endpoints, change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 and CIBIC+ at Week
24, and for the secondary efficacy endpoint, mean NPI-X values from Week 4 to Week
24.  Adjusted means for all 3 endpoints were similar across all treatment groups. 
There were an increased number of dermatologic adverse events reported in the active
treatment groups as compared to the placebo group.  There were 3 serious adverse 
events.  In addition, there were 3 deaths that were deemed unrelated to treatment.
For the laboratory data, subjects in both the xanomeline low and high dose groups 
showed more observations above normal range than the placebo group.  Albumin was 
more often lower than the normal range for subjects in the placebo and xanomeline low 
dose group.  Subjects in the xanomeline treatment groups had statistically significantly 
more values above the normal range than subjects in the placebo group for both urea 
nitrogen and eosinophils.  There was a statistically significant association between 
clinically significant changes from the previous visit and treatment group for aspartate 
aminotransferase and eosinophils.  Shifts from baseline for eosinophils were statistically 
significant with both xanomeline treatment groups showing more changes from normal
to above normal than the placebo group.  There was no significant association with 
treatment group in the Hy’s law analysis examining shifts in liver function tests between
baseline values and values while on treatment.
There were only minor changes from baseline in vital signs and weight at Week 24.

INTRODUCTION 
The objective of the CDISC SDTM/ADaM Pilot Project is to demonstrate the effective 
transformation of legacy data into CDISC SDTM domains and ADaM datasets and their 
associated metadata.  The Project team will produce a “pilot submission” that will be 
delivered to FDA reviewers for their evaluation in a mock review, assessing whether data 
submitted to the FDA using the CDISC Standard will meet the needs and expectations of
both medical and statistical FDA reviewers. This abbreviated study report documents the 
analysis results of the legacy data for this first pilot submission.
The legacy data being used in CDISCPILOT01 were provided by Eli Lilly and Company 
(Legacy Sponsor) for the purposes of this CDISC Pilot Project. The data were 
de-identified and documents were redacted prior to release to the CDISC Pilot Project
team.  De-identification included changing dates and shifting them into the future. All 
chronological relationships and sequences were maintained within the data elements for a 
subject (e.g., no change in the relationship of timing of adverse events with respect to 
dosing).  The submission did not reproduce all of the Legacy Sponsor’s analyses and 
reports.  Instead only the more common elements of a submission were addressed.  These 
included safety data, the primary efficacy endpoints and a few secondary efficacy 
endpoints.  Deviations from the protocol-specified analyses are described in the statistical 
analysis plan created specifically for this study as part of the CDISC Pilot Project 
(Appendix 9).

STUDY OBJECTIVES
The primary objectives of this study were: 
x To determine if there is a statistically significant relationship (overall Type 1 error
rate, D=0.05) between the change in both the ADAS-Cog (11) and CIBIC+ 
scores, and drug dose (0, 50 cm2 [54 mg], and 75 cm2 [81 mg]).
x To document the safety profile of the xanomeline TTS. 
A secondary objective of this study was: 
x To assess the dose-dependent improvement in behavior. Improved scores on the 
Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X) will indicate improvement in these 
areas.

INVESTIGATIONAL PLAN
9.1.
Overall Study Design and Plan
This study was a prospective, randomized, multi-center, double-blind, placebo-
controlled, parallel-group study. The objectives of the study were to evaluate the efficacy 
and safety of transdermal xanomeline, 50 cm2 and 75 cm2, and placebo in subjects with 
mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.
Xanomeline or placebo was administered daily in the morning, with the application of
two adhesive patches, one 50 cm2 in area, the other 25 cm2 in area.  Doses were measured
in terms of the xanomeline base, and were 54 mg for the 50 cm2 patch and 27 mg for the 
25 cm2 patch. Placebo was identical in appearance to the primary study material. The 
total doses being compared are therefore 0 (both patches placebo), 54 mg (large patch 
active drug, small patch placebo), and 81 mg (both patches active drug). The treatment
groups referred to throughout this report will be “xanomeline high dose,” “xanomeline
low dose,” and “placebo”.
Subjects were males or females of non-childbearing potential, 50 years of age or older, 
had probable mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease according to the NINCDS-ADRDA
criteria, and an MMSE score of 10 to 23.  The duration of treatment was 26 weeks, with 
24 weeks of active treatment.  Approximately 300 subjects were to be enrolled and 
randomized equally to xanomeline high dose, xanomeline low dose, or placebo. 
Subjects were assessed for efficacy using the Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale -

Discussion of Study Design, Including the Choice of Control
Groups
This study was designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the low and high dose 
xanomeline relative to placebo in subjects with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease.
Subjects were randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups: placebo, xanomeline low dose and 
xanomeline high dose.  Two patches were administered to each subject in a double-blind 
fashion to minimize investigator and subject bias.  Placebo was the control group used in 
this study. 
9.3. 
Selection of Study Population
Subjects were included in the study if they were males or females of non-childbearing 
potential, 50 years of age or older, had probable mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease 
according to the NINCDS-ADRDA criteria, had an MMSE score of 10 to 23, had a 
Hachinski Ischemic Scale score of  4, and CNS imaging compatible with Alzheimer’s
disease within the past year.  Subjects were excluded from the study if they had 
previously participated in a xanomeline study, had used an investigational or approved 
Alzheimer’s therapeutic medication within 30 days of prior to enrollment, serious illness 
requiring hospitalization within 3 months prior to screening, have certain concurrent or 
historical medical conditions, or were concurrently or historically using certain 
medications.  Details of the inclusions and exclusion criteria are included in the study 
protocol (Appendix 1).

Treatments
Subjects were randomized to 1 of the 3 treatment groups: placebo, xanomeline low or 
high dose.  Xanomeline or placebo was administered daily in the morning, with the 
application of two adhesive patches, one 50 cm2 in area, the other 25 cm2 in area.  Doses 
were measured in terms of the xanomeline base, and were 54 mg for the 50 cm2 patch and 
27 mg for the 25 cm2 patch. Placebo was identical in appearance to the primary study 
material.  Xanomeline high dose group received an active patch of each size and the 
xanomeline low dose received an active large patch and a placebo small patch.  The total 
doses being compared are therefore 0 (both patches placebo), 54 mg (large patch active 
drug, small patch placebo), and 81 mg (both patches active drug). The treatment groups 
referred to throughout this report will be “xanomeline high dose,” “xanomeline low
dose,” and “placebo”.

Efficacy and Safety Variables
Efficacy in this study was assessed using Alzheimer’s Disease Assessment Scale - 
Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog), Video-referenced Clinician’s Interview-based 
Impression of Change (CIBIC+), and Revised Neuropsychiatric Inventory (NPI-X).  The 
ADAS-Cog is an established measure of cognitive function in Alzheimer’s disease.  This
study will specifically use an 11-item subscale of the ADAS-Cog, denoted as 
ADAS-Cog (11).  The CIBIC+ is an assessment of the global clinical status relative to 
baseline and utilizes semi-structured interviews with the subject and the caregiver.  The
NPI-X is an assessment of change in psychopathology in subjects with dementia and is 
administered to the designated caregiver.  Methods for scoring the ADAS-Cog (11), 
CIBIC+, and NPI-X are noted in the statistical analysis plan (Appendix 9).
Safety in this study was assessed with the reporting of adverse events, laboratory 
measures, and vital signs.  The list of laboratory measures is noted in the study protocol 
(Appendix 1).
The schedule of efficacy and safety assessments is listed in the study protocol (Appendix 
1).  Additional efficacy and safety assessments were utilized in this protocol, but were not 
included in this study report due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project.

The following baseline characteristics were summarized by treatment group and across 
all treatment groups:  age, age category (<65, 65-80, >80), sex, race, Mini-Mental State 
(MMSE), duration of Alzheimer's disease, years of education, weight, height, BMI, and 
BMI category (BMI<25, BMI 25-<30, BMI>=30).  The treatment groups were compared
by analysis of variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and by Pearson’s chi-square 
test for categorical variables.
9.7.1.3. 
Efficacy
The primary analysis of the ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 used the efficacy population 
with LOCF imputation for any missing values at Week 24. An ANCOVA model was 
used with the baseline score, site, and treatment included as independent variables.
Treatment was included as a continuous variable, and results for a test of dose response 
were produced.  If the test for dose response was statistically significant, pairwise 
comparisons among the 3 groups were to be performed and evaluated at a significance 
level of 0.05.  Similar analyses were performed at Weeks 8 and 16.  Summary statistics 
were generated for each visit using the efficacy population with LOCF imputation. 
A supportive analysis for the ADAS-Cog (11) used a likelihood-based repeated measures
(MMRM) analysis.  In this analysis for the change from baseline in the ADAS-Cog (11) 
at Week 24, the independent variables included in the model were the fixed, categorical 
effects of treatment, site, time (week), and treatment by time interaction along with the 
continuous effects of baseline ADAS-Cog (11) score and baseline ADAS-Cog (11) score 
by time interaction. 
The primary analysis of CIBIC+ at Week 24 used the efficacy population with LOCF 
imputation for any missing values at Week 24.  For this endpoint, an ANOVA model was 
used with site, and treatment included as independent variables.  Treatment was included 
as a continuous variable, and results for a test of dose response were produced.  If the test 
for dose response was statistically significant, pairwise comparisons among the 3 groups 
were to be performed and evaluated at a significance level of 0.05.  Similar analyses were 
performed at Weeks 8 and 16. 
The primary analysis of mean NPI-X total score from Week 4 to Week 24 used the 
efficacy population.  This endpoint was calculated as the mean of all available total
scores between Weeks 4 and 24, inclusive.  For this endpoint, an ANCOVA model was 
used with the baseline score, site, and treatment included as independent variables.
Treatment was included as a continuous variable, and results for a test of dose response 
were produced.  If the test for dose response was statistically significant, pairwise 
comparisons among the 3 groups were to be performed and evaluated at a significance 
level of 0.05.

Safety
Average daily dose and cumulative dose at end of study (Week 26 or early termination)
was computed for each subject based on the planned dose and the actual number of days 
in the study and was summarized for each treatment group. 
Adverse events were coded according to MedDRA.  Due to the nature of the CDISC Pilot 
Project, the higher level terms and higher level group terms of the MedDRA coding were 
masked.  In addition, no numeric MedDRA codes are included in the databases.
Treatment emergent adverse events and serious adverse events were summarized by SOC 
(system organ class) and preferred term (PT).  The incidence of treatment emergent
events grouped under preferred terms for each active treatment were compared to placebo
using Fisher’s exact test. 
Additional analysis of dermatological adverse events was conducted.  A category of 
special events was created to identify the events that were considered dermatological
events.  These events were determined by a thorough  review of blinded coded adverse 
event terms and all preferred terms that were considered to be dermatologic in nature, 
such as rash, pruritus, or dermatitis, were flagged as adverse events of special interest.
The time to the first dermatological event was compared across the treatment groups 
using Kaplan-Meier methods.  Graphical displays of the survival curves were produced.
Hematology and clinical chemistry values were summarized at each visit week, for each 
analyte, for each treatment group.  Four assessments of abnormality were identified for 
each laboratory analyte:
x Values outside the normal range 
x Values significantly beyond the normal range (i.e., outside the threshold range) 
x Values differing significantly from values at the previous scheduled visit, 
x Abnormal values as defined by Hy’s Law 
The number of subjects with no abnormal measure during treatment and those with at 
least one abnormal measure during treatment were summarized for each lab analyte.
Two tables were provided – one defining abnormal as beyond normal range (i.e., below 
LLN or above ULN) and the other defining abnormal as a clinically significant change 
from the previous visit.  Fisher’s exact test was used to analyze the incidence of abnormal
(high or low) measures during the post-randomization phase. 
A display summarizing shifts from baseline by week in terms of abnormality based on 
threshold range was provided. The data were summarized using sets of 3-by-3 matrices
comparing baseline and on drug categorization for each treatment group for each week 
for each laboratory analyte. 
Shift tables summarizing whether a subject’s status changed from baseline during the 
treatment period were provided for changes based on threshold ranges and changes based 
on Hy’s Law.  Two variations of the modified Hy’s Law criteria were used in the

assessment.  The first considered subjects with transaminase (ALT or AST) elevations of 
greater than 1.5 times ULN as abnormal.  The second further narrowed the assessment of 
abnormality to require total bilirubin elevations to be greater than 1.5 times ULN in 
addition to transaminase elevations of greater than 1.5 times ULN.  In these tables a 
subject was categorized as normal or abnormal (i.e., outside the threshold range) at 
baseline.  During the treatment phase, the most extreme value was used to categorize a 
subject as normal or abnormal during the treatment phase. The shift table shows the 
number of subjects whose on treatment categorization was the same or shifted from the
baseline categorization. The treatment period was defined as any planned visit after Week 
0 (Visit 3), up to and including Week 24 (Visit 12).  Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH)
tests, stratifying by status at baseline, were performed.
Vital sign data (blood pressure supine, blood pressure standing 1 minute, blood pressure 
standing 3 minutes, heart rate supine, heart rate standing 1 minute, and heart rate standing 
3 minutes) at baseline, week 24 and end of treatment (last visit on or before week 24 
visit) was summarized by treatment group.  Change from baseline was also summarized.
Weight data at baseline and Week 24 (with and without including early terminations) was 
summarized by treatment group.  Change from baseline was also summarized.
The concomitant medication data were coded using a publicly available sample of WHO 
Drug.  The data were matched to a preferred term and an anatomical class (ATC level 1).
Drugs not matching those in the sample were considered “uncoded” for the purposes of 
this submission.  Due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project, drugs were matched to 
only one class.  The number and percent of subjects receiving each concomitant
medication were summarized.  Concomitant medications were reported by anatomical
class and ingredient.  Medications were sorted in descending order of total incidence 
across treatment groups for anatomical class and in descending order of total incidence 
for the ingredient within each anatomical class.  If the total incidence for any two or more 
ingredients is equal, the events were presented in alphabetical order. 
9.7.2.
Determination of Sample Size 
Approximately 100 subjects were to be randomized to each of the 3 treatment groups. 
Previous experience with the oral formulation of xanomeline suggested that this sample
size had 90% power to detect a 3.0 mean treatment difference in ADAS-Cog (p < 0.05, 
two-sided), based on a standard deviation of 6.5. Furthermore, this sample size had 80% 
power to detect a 0.36 mean treatment difference in CIBIC+ (p < 0.05, two-sided), based 
on a standard deviation of 0.9.

Changes in Study Conduct or Planned Analyses
The protocol was amended 3 times.  For the first 2 amendments, changes were made to 
the ambulatory ECG assessments.  These changes included shortening the duration of the 
ambulatory ECG monitoring from 48 to 24 hours prior to visit 3, adding monitoring prior 
to visit 4, removing monitoring prior to visit 6, and subsequently removing the 
monitoring prior to visit 4.  During the time the additional monitoring prior to visit 4 was 
required, a visit (designated as visit 3e) was added for the placement of the ambulatory
ECG equipment.  Other changes in the study conduct are not described in this study 
report due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project.
Changes to the protocol-specified analyses are described in the statistical analysis plan
(Appendix 9).  These changes included omission of secondary or sensitivity analyses, 
omission of some efficacy endpoints, omission of some safety endpoints, and the 
inclusion of additional types of analyses.

STUDY SUBJECTS
10.1. 
Disposition of Subjects
Table 14-1.01 provides a summary of the subjects in each analysis population. A total of
306 subjects have demographic information in the study tabulation database 
(Figure 10-1).  Fifty-two (52) subjects were not randomized, and thus were screen 
failures.  The remaining 254 subjects were randomized and entered the double-blind 
treatment phase.  These subjects comprise the Intent-to-Treat population. The number of
subjects randomized to each treatment arm was: 86 to placebo, 84 to the xanomeline low 
dose treatment group and 84 to the xanomeline high dose treatment group.  Of the 254 
subjects randomized to treatment, 118 completed the treatment phase (Week 24), and 110 
completed the study through Week 26.

Table 14-1.03 summarizes the disposition of the population by site.  The table provides 
the number of subjects randomized and completing Week 24, per treatment group, for 
each site. Of the 17 sites participating in the study, 7 met the pre-specified criteria for 
small sample sizes, requiring them to be grouped together for the purposes of analyses 
including site as a covariate, as shown in Table 14-1.03.
A total of 136 subjects prematurely discontinued from the study prior to Week 24.
Table 14-1.02 provides a summary of the reasons for premature discontinuation for these 
subjects.  There was a statistically significant association between the number of subjects 
discontinuing the study and the treatment group (p < 0.0001), with 30% of placebo 
subjects terminating early as compared to 67% of the xanomeline low dose subjects, and 
64% of the xanomeline high dose subjects. The most common reason for discontinuation 
was adverse event (9% placebo subjects, 52% xanomeline low dose subjects, 46% 
xanomeline high dose subjects), with a statistically significant association between 
discontinuation due to adverse event and treatment group (p < 0.0001).

11.1. 
Data Sets Analyzed
Table 14-1.01 provides the summary of study populations analyzed in this protocol.
Subjects were randomly assigned to treatment groups at Week 0 (Visit 3). All subjects 
who were randomized comprised the Intent-to-Treat (ITT) Population. A total of 254 
subjects (86 in the placebo group; 84 in the xanomeline low dose group; 84 in the 
xanomeline high dose group) were randomized.
All subjects randomized and known to have taken at least one dose of randomized drug 
were included in the Safety Population.  Of the 254 subjects randomized, all took a dose 
of the randomized study drug and were included in the Safety Population. Note that the 
first patches were applied at the randomization visit.
All subjects who were randomized and took at least one dose of randomized drug (i.e., 
were in the Safety Population), and have at least one post-baseline measure for both 
ADAS-Cog and CIBIC+ were included in the Efficacy Population.  Twenty (20) of the
subjects in Safety Population did not have a post-randomization ADAS-Cog assessment
and a post-randomization CIBIC+ assessment, thus 234 subjects (79 placebo; 81 
xanomeline low dose; 74 xanomeline high dose) comprised the Efficacy Population. 
The 118 subjects (60 placebo; 28 xanomeline low dose; 30 xanomeline high dose) who 
were in the Efficacy Population and completed their Week 24 visit (Visit 12) comprised
the Completers Population. Eight (8) subjects discontinued between Week 24 and Week
26, leaving 110 subjects (58 placebo; 25 xanomeline low dose; 27 xanomeline high dose) 
who completed the study.

weight at baseline differed across treatment groups (p-value = 0.003), with placebo 
subjects having a mean weight of 62.8 kg (SD 12.77; range 34.0-86.2), xanomeline low 
dose subjects having a mean weight of 67.3 kg (SD 14.12; range 45.4-106.1), and 
xanomeline high dose subjects having a mean weight of 70.0 kg (SD 14.65; range 41.7-

Efficacy Results
There are 2 co-primary efficacy endpoints in this study: the change from baseline in 
ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 and the CIBIC+ score at Week 24.  Hypothesis testing for 
both of these endpoints considered whether there is a statistically significant dose 
response among the 3 treatment groups.  The significance level for each of these 
endpoints is 0.05. 
11.4.1. 
ADAS-Cog (11)
Table 14-3.01 presents the summary statistics for baseline and Week 24 values for 
ADAS-Cog (11) and the change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24.  These 
results are based on the efficacy population with LOCF imputation.  The mean scores 
across all 3 treatment groups are similar at baseline with the similar worsening in scores
by Week 24.  Accordingly, the dose response for the change from baseline at Week 24, 
adjusted for site and baseline score is not statistically significantly different from 0.
Pairwise comparisons among the treatment groups are also presented in Table 14-3.01,
but should not be considered since the dose response analysis was not statistically 
significant.
Similar analyses were performed at Weeks 8 and 16 (Table 14-3.03 and Table 14-3.05).
Likewise, no dose response was seen at these earlier time points. 
To check the robustness of the imputation method, a sensitivity analysis using only the 
observed values was performed (Table 14-3.07).  Although the xanomeline low dose 
group had a smaller mean change from baseline at Week 24, the dose response in this 
analysis was also not statistically significantly different from 0. 
Subgroup analyses by gender were also performed using the LOCF-imputed values 
(Table 14-3.08 and Table 14-3.09).  The males in the xanomeline low dose group had a 
mean change from baseline that was higher than the other 2 groups, but the dose response 
was not statistically significantly.  The dose response in the female subgroup was 
trending in a positive direction (p = 0.094) indicating that higher doses may result in 
smaller changes by Week 24.  Mean (SD) changes from baseline at Week 24 for the 
placebo, xanomeline low dose, and xanomeline high dose were 3.0 (5.57), 1.7 (5.54), and 
1.1 (4.77), respectively. 
Summary statistics for the actual values and the change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) 
are presented in Table 14-3.10 for both the observed values by visit window and LOCF-
imputed values. 
A repeated measures analysis was performed on ADAS-Cog (11) using postbaseline 
changes from baseline (Table 14-3.11) to examine treatment effect over time.  Covariates 
included in the model were treatment, site, time, treatment by time interaction, baseline

score, and baseline by time interaction.  Adjusted means for the change from baseline at 
Week 24 were similar across the 3 treatment groups.  Pairwise comparisons among the 3 
treatment groups were not statistically significantly different. 
11.4.2. 
CIBIC+ 
Table 14-3.02 presents the summary statistics for the Week 24 values for CIBIC+.  These 
results are based on the efficacy population with LOCF imputation.  The mean scores 
across all 3 treatment groups are similar at Week 24.  Accordingly, the dose response for 
the CIBIC+ score at Week 24, adjusted for site is not statistically significantly different 
from 0.  Pairwise comparisons among the treatment groups are also presented in Table
14-3.02, but should not be considered since the dose response analysis was not 
statistically significant.
Similar analyses were performed at Weeks 8 and 16 (Table 14-3.04 and Table 14-3.06).
Likewise, no dose response was seen at these earlier time points. 
An analysis not specified in the protocol was performed considering CIBIC+ scores as a 
categorical variable (Table 14-3.13).  This analysis used the LOCF-imputed values and 
compared treatment groups at Weeks 8, 16, and 24.  Distributions of scores between the 3 
treatment groups were not statistically significantly different. 
11.4.3. 
NPI-X 
Table 14-3.12 presents the summary statistics for the baseline NPI-X score and for the 
mean of the observed values from Weeks 4 to 24, inclusive.  The mean NPI-X value at 
baseline for the xanomeline high dose group was slightly larger than the other 2 groups.
The dose response for the mean of the Week 4 through Week 24 values, adjusted for site 
and baseline value, was not statistically significantly different from 0.  Pairwise 
comparisons among the treatment groups are also presented in Table 14-3.12, but should 
not be considered since the dose response analysis was not statistically significant.
11.5. 
Efficacy Conclusions
A statistically significant dose response was not seen for either of the primary efficacy 
endpoints: changes from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 and CIBIC+ at Week
24.  Adjusted means for these 2 endpoints were similar for all 3 treatment groups.
Additional analyses at earlier time points showed similar results.  Subgroup analyses by 
gender, a sensitivity analysis for missing data, and a repeated measures analysis for
ADAS-Cog (11) also indicated lack of treatment response.  The secondary efficacy 
endpoint of the mean NPI-X values from Week 4 through Week 24 also did not 
demonstrate a statistically significant dose response.

SAFETY EVALUATION
12.1. 
Extent of Exposure
For the purposes of this submission, planned exposure was summarized.  It was assumed 
that while the subject was in the study the subject took the randomized drug as planned, 
with the first dose occurring on the date of randomization (Week 0), and the new dose 
levels occurring on the day following the Week 2 visit and the Week 24 visit.  The date 
of last dose was that indicated on the CRF.  If no date of last dose was available, the date 
of discontinuation was assumed to be the date of last dose. 
A total of 254 subjects received randomized drug during the study.  Eighty-six (86) 
subjects received placebo, 84 received xanomeline low dose and 84 received xanomeline
high dose.  The mean daily dose was 54.0 mg and 71.6 mg for the low dose and high dose 
treatment groups, respectively, as shown in Table 14-4.01.
12.2. 
Adverse Events
12.2.1.
Brief Summary of Adverse Events
A summary of total adverse events across all body systems showed an increase in adverse 
events associated with randomized drug with over 90% of subjects receiving active
therapy reporting at least one adverse event compared to 75.6% of subjects receiving 
placebo (Table 14-5.01).  However, this difference is due largely to a disproportionate 
number of dermatologic type events that occurred in the xanomeline treatment groups.
Therefore, with the exception of dermatologic irritation (discussed below), the overall 
adverse event profile does not suggest that there is a specific hazard associated with 
either dose of xanomeline.
The number of serious adverse events reported during this study were minimal
(Table 14-5.02) and do not suggest that there is any pattern attributable to active therapy.
There were 3 deaths observed during the course of the study, yet none of these were 
flagged as being serious events.

Analysis of Adverse Events 
The adverse event profile of the treatment groups was generally similar across the 
treatment groups.  With the exception of skin related adverse events, discussed below, the 
most commonly reported events (reported by t 5% of subjects in any treatment group) 
were reported in numerous body systems and did not show a consistent treatment
dependent pattern.  There were noted differences (p < 0.150) between placebo and at least 
one of the active therapy groups in the incidence of sinus bradycardia (2.3% placebo, 
8.3% low dose, and 9.5% high dose), fatigue (1.2% placebo, 6.0% xanomeline low dose, 
6.0% xanomeline high dose), dizziness (2.3% placebo, 9.5% xanomeline low dose, 
13.1% xanomeline high dose), cough (1.2% placebo, 6.0% xanomeline low dose, 6.0% 
xanomeline high dose), and hyperhiridosis (2.3% placebo, 4.8% xanomeline low dose,
9.5% xanomeline high dose).  Upper respiratory tract infection was reported more
frequently in the placebo group (7.0%) compared with the xanomeline low dose group 
(1.2%, p < 0.150) but not the xanomeline high dose group (3.6%).

Analysis of Death, Other Serious Adverse Events, and Other 
Significant Adverse Events 
12.3.1. 
Deaths 
There were 3 deaths reported during the conduct of this study with 2 subjects in the 
placebo group and 1 subject randomized to xanomeline low dose.  None of these deaths 
were recorded as serious adverse events yet two of the deaths were clearly of serious 
nature (myocardial infarction and sudden death) and the other death being a suicide.
None of the deaths were judged related to treatment.
12.3.2.
Other Serious Adverse Events 
There were a total of 3 serious adverse events reported in 3 individual subjects, 2 of 
whom were in the xanomeline high dose and 1 in the xanomeline low dose group
(Table 14-5.02).  All 3 events were events related to the nervous system.  Due to the low 
numbers of serious adverse events, it is not possible to make any conclusions regarding 
the relationship of these events and treatment group.
12.3.3.
Dermatologic Adverse Events 
A special category of dermatologic events was created prior to unblinding.  This category 
combines all adverse events that were considered to be of dermatologic importance after 
a thorough medical review of the coded adverse events.  The preferred terms listed in 
Table 12-2 were included in this category of special interest adverse events.

As shown on the table at the bottom of Figure 14-1, there was a disproportionate number
of subjects in the xanomeline treatment groups who experienced a special interest 
dermatologic adverse event with 74% (n = 62) of xanomeline low dose and 73% (n = 61) 
of xanomeline high dose subjects with at least one event of special interest compared to 
34% (n = 29) of placebo subjects.  This high rate of dermatologic events most likely 
contributed to the larger proportion of subjects in the active treatment groups who 
discontinued the study due to an adverse event (Table 14-1.02).
An analysis of the time to the first dermatologic event indicated that the median time to 
first event was significantly different (p<0.0001) between treatment groups with a median
time of 33 days in the xanomeline low dose group (95% CI: 27 – 48 days) and 36 days in 
the xanomeline high dose group (95% CI: 24 – 46 days) compared to placebo, in which 
the median time to first event was not estimable (Figure 14-1).

Narratives of Deaths, Other Serious Adverse Events and Certain 
Other Significant Adverse Events
Narratives for subjects who died while on-study are included below.  Narratives for
subjects who reported other serious adverse events or other significant adverse events are 
not included in this study report due to the nature of this CDISC Pilot Project.
Subject 01-701-1211, a 76-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s dementia, began receiving 
xanomeline low dose on 15 November 2012.  The subject was diagnosed with 
Alzheimer’s dementia in 2010.  The subject also had non-insulin dependent diabetes 
mellitus, which was considered to be mild in severity.  The subject experienced sudden 
death on 14 January 2013.  This death was considered by the investigator to be unrelated 
to study medication.  No action was taken for this event and study medication was not 
discontinued prior to death.  Eight other adverse events were reported for this subject yet 
none were classified as being serious and none appeared to contribute to the sudden 
death.
Subject 01-701-1445, a 75-year-old man with Alzheimer’s dementia, began receiving 
placebo on 11 May 2014.  The subject was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia in 
2012.  The subject also suffered from mild forms of non-insulin dependent diabetes 
mellitus, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and benign prostatic hyperplasia.  This
subject committed suicide on 31 October 2014.  This death was considered by the 
investigator to be unrelated to study medication.  No action was taken for this event and 
study medication was not discontinued prior to death.  No other adverse events were 
reported by this subject. 
Subject 01-701-1083, an 89-year-old woman with Alzheimer’s dementia, began receiving 
placebo on 22 July 2013.  The subject was diagnosed with Alzheimer’s dementia in 2011.
This subject had previous history of cardiovascular disease: implanted cardiac 
pacemaker, first degree atrioventricular block, and a history of myocardial infarction and

angina pectoris in 2006.  The subject experienced a fatal myocardial infarction on 
2 August 2013.  This event required hospitalization.  The event was considered by the 
investigator to be possibly related to study medication.  No action was taken for this 
event and study medication was not discontinued prior to death.  No other adverse events 
were reported by this subject. 
12.4.
Clinical Laboratory Evaluation
Table 14-6.01 to Table 14-6.05 summarize the findings for the laboratory data analysis. 
Commonly used laboratory analytes (as defined by the CDISC coding document) that 
were measured with sufficient frequency were reported.  Hematology analytes that meet 
this criterion are: hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean
corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), 
leukocyte count, lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, basophils, platelet count, and 
erythrocyte count.  Clinical chemistry analytes that meet this criterion are: sodium,
potassium, chloride, total bilirubin, alkaline phosphatase, gamma-glutamyl transferase 
(GGT, GGPT, SGGT, YGGT), alanine aminotransferase (ALT, SGPT), aspartate 
aminotransferase (AST, SGOT), urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, inorganic 
phosphorus, calcium, non-fasting glucose, total protein, albumin, cholesterol, and 
creatine phosphokinase.  Urinalysis and other lab data were not summarized, but were 
included in the tabulation datasets. 
The hematology and clinical chemistry measures were summarized for baseline and 
Weeks 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, and 26 (visits 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13, 
respectively). The baseline values were those collected at Week -2 (visit 1). Table 14-
6.01 presents summaries of these results by week. This table provides descriptive 
statistics (n, mean, and standard deviation) for the measured value in standard units as 
well as the change from baseline. The change from baseline laboratory value was 
calculated as the difference between the baseline lab value and the endpoint value (i.e., 
the value at the specified visit) or the end of treatment observation.  These results are 
shown by treatment group.
Table 14-6.02 and Table 14-6.03 summarize each laboratory value, including the baseline 
value, as categorized with reference to the lab normal range as
x “L” - less than or equal to the lower limit of normal (LLN) 
x “N” – Greater than the LLN and less than the upper limit of normal (ULN) 
x “H” – Greater than or equal to the ULN 
Laboratory values were assigned a flag of abnormal (high or low) if the value was outside 
the threshold range (defined as significantly beyond the normal range, i.e., > 1.5 times
ULN or < 0.5 times LLN) or if the value was significantly different from the value 
observed at the preceding scheduled visit (i.e., absolute value of the change from

previous value is larger than the 50% of the normal range, LLN to ULN).  Shift tables 
summarizing whether a subject’s status changed from baseline at each week of treatment
and during the treatment period are provided based on threshold ranges and changes 
based on Hy’s Law.  Two variations of the modified Hy’s Law criteria were used in the 
assessment.  The first considered subjects with transaminase (ALT or AST) elevations of 
greater than 1.5 times ULN as abnormal.  The second further narrowed the assessment of 
abnormality to require total bilirubin elevations to be greater than 1.5 times ULN in 
addition to transaminase elevations of greater than 1.5 times ULN.  In these tables 
subjects were categorized as normal or abnormal (i.e., outside the threshold range) at 
baseline.  During the treatment phase, the most extreme value was used to categorize a 
subject as normal or abnormal during the treatment phase. The shift table shows the 
number of subjects whose on treatment categorization was the same or shifted from the
baseline categorization. The treatment phase is defined as any planned visit after Week 0 
(Visit 3), up to and including Week 24 (Visit 12).
The number of subjects with no abnormal measure during treatment and those with at 
least one abnormal measure during treatment are summarized for each lab analyte.
Table 14-6.02 provides an analysis with abnormal as beyond normal range (i.e., below 
LLN or above ULN). Table 14-6.03 provides the analysis based on abnormal as a 
clinically significant change from the previous visit.
As shown in Table 14-6.02, only three laboratory analytes were statistically significantly 
associated with treatment group: albumin (p = 0.042), urea nitrogen (p = 0.023), and 
eosinophils (p = 0.001).  There were four additional analytes that were nearly significant:
chloride (p = 0.058), hematocrit (p = 0.052), hemoglobin (p = 0.093), and MCV 
(p = 0.077).  Albumin was more often lower than normal range for subjects in the placebo 
and xanomeline low dose groups.  Subjects in the xanomeline treatment groups had 
statistically significantly more values above the normal range than subjects in the placebo 
group for urea nitrogen [placebo=9 (11%), xanomeline low dose group =22 (27%), 
xanomeline high dose group=12 (15%)] and eosinophils [placebo=0, xanomeline low
dose group =11 (13%), xanomeline high dose group=7 (9%)].
Table 14-6.03 shows the number of clinically significant changes from previous visit by 
treatment group for each analyte.  The association between clinically significant change
from the previous visit and treatment was statistically significant for aspartate 
aminotransferase (p = 0.045) and eosinophils (p = 0.010).  Nearly significant were 
protein (p = 0.062) and monocytes (p = 0.081).
Table 14-6.04 summarizes shifts from baseline by week in terms of abnormality based on 
threshold range. The data in this table were summarized using sets of 3-by-3 tables 
comparing baseline and on drug categorization for each treatment group for each week 
for each laboratory analyte. Because no subjects were abnormally low at baseline, only
the normal at baseline and high at baseline data are shown.

In Table 14-6.05, a CMH test, stratifying by status at baseline, is shown. This test was 
performed to assess the association of significant shifts from baseline for each analyte
with treatment group. The number of subjects with no abnormal measure during 
treatment and those with at least one abnormal measure during treatment was 
summarized for each lab analyte.  Nineteen of the 30 analytes could not be analyzed 
because they had less than two non-missing levels.  Of the 11 remaining analytes, only 
shifts from baseline to treatment phase for eosinophils were statistically significantly
related to treatment group (p = 0.044).  For eosinophils, the number of subjects in each 
group that showed a shift from normal to high were 0 in the placebo group, 5 (6%) in the 
xanomeline low dose group, and 6 (8%) in the xanomeline high dose group. 
Finally, Table 14-6.06 reports the results of the Hy’s Law analysis.  Of the cases where 
transaminase was greater than 1.5 times ULN, 3 subjects in the placebo group, 1 in the
xanomeline low dose, and 3 in the xanomeline high dose shifted from normal at baseline 
to above normal during treatment.  In addition, 2 subjects in the placebo group and 1 in 
the xanomeline low dose group had an elevated transaminase at baseline that remained
high during treatment, and 1 subject in the xanomeline low dose group had an elevated 
transaminase at baseline that became normal during treatment.  There were no subjects in 
the xanomeline treatment groups and 1 subject in the placebo group who had both 
transaminase levels greater than 1.5 times ULN and total bilirubin greater than 1.5 times 
ULN.  A CMH test for an association with treatment group was not statistically 
significant for either Hy’s law assessment.
12.5.
Vital Signs and Weight
Vital signs and weight were to be collected for all subjects at each visit.  For the purposes
of this submission, vital signs were summarized only for baseline and Week 24 and end 
of treatment.  End of treatment is defined to be the last on-treatment assessment of the
specified measure.
12.5.1.
Vital Signs Summary
Table 14-7.01 presents a summary of the vital sign data (systolic blood pressure [SBP], 
diastolic blood pressure [DBP] and pulse) collected at baseline (Week 0), Week 24, and 
end of treatment.
Table 14-7.02 summarizes the changes in vital signs at Week 24 and end of treatment as 
compared to values at the baseline visit (Week 0).
Table 12-3 presents summary statistics for SBP, DBP, and pulse after standing for 3 
minutes.  These assessments are representative of the vitals taken at other positions and
time points in terms of the relationships among treatment groups. Measurements were 
also taken after the subject had been lying down for 5 minutes and after the subject had

taken after the subject had been standing for 3 minutes. 
Vital sign values at baseline were comparable across treatment groups.  Changes from

Safety Conclusions
Over 90% of subjects receiving active therapy reported at least 1 adverse event compared
to 75.6% of subjects receiving placebo. This difference is due largely to a 
disproportionate number of dermatologic type events that occurred in the xanomeline
treatment groups.  Approximately 73% of the subjects in either of the xanomeline groups 
experienced at least one dermatologic adverse event of interest compared to 33.6% of the 
placebo subjects.  There was a statistically significant difference (p < 0.001) in the time
to first dermatologic event between the treatment groups.  There were 3 deaths (2 in 
placebo group, 1 in the xanomeline low dose group) observed during the study.  None of 
the deaths were judged related to treatment.  Aside from the deaths, there were 3 serious 
adverse events reported in 3 subjects (2 in xanomeline high dose and 1 in the xanomeline
low dose group) and all were related to the nervous system.
The association between treatment group and the number of abnormal values beyond the 
normal range was significant for three laboratory analytes: albumin (p = 0.042), urea 
nitrogen (p = 0.023), and eosinophils (p = 0.001).  The association between clinically 
significant changes from the previous visit and treatment was statistically significant for 
aspartate aminotransferase (p = 0.045) and eosinophils (p = 0.010).  The analysis of shifts 
from baseline to most abnormal value could not be calculated on 19 of the analytes.  Of 
the remaining 11 analytes, only eosinophils showed a statistically significant association 
with treatment group (p = 0.044).  There was no significant association with treatment
group in the Hy’s law analyses examining shifts in transaminase levels, and transaminase
and total bilirubin levels between baseline values and values while on treatment.
Changes from baseline in vital signs (SBP, DBP, and pulse), at the Week 24 and end of 
treatment assessments, were generally small decreases.  Changes from baseline in weight,
at the Week 24 and end of treatment assessments, however, were generally small with no 
treatment-related pattern of increases or decreases.

DISCUSSION OF STUDY RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS 
A statistically significantly higher proportion of subjects in the active treatment groups 
withdrew prematurely from the study as compared to the placebo group.  This is largely 
due to the higher proportion of subjects in the active treatment groups experiencing a 
dermatologic event and subsequently resulting in premature withdrawal from the study.
This further hindered the study’s ability to demonstrate efficacy. 
A statistically significant dose response was not seen for both of the primary efficacy 
endpoints, change from baseline in ADAS-Cog (11) at Week 24 and CIBIC+ at Week 24, 
and for the secondary efficacy endpoint, mean NPI-X values from Week 4 to Week 24.
Adjusted means for all 3 endpoints were similar across all treatment groups. 
There were an increased number of dermatologic adverse events reported in the active
treatment groups as compared to the placebo group.  There were 3 serious adverse events.
In addition, there were 3 deaths that were deemed unrelated to treatment.
For the laboratory data, subjects in both the xanomeline low and high dose groups 
showed more observations above normal range than the placebo group.  Albumin was 
more often lower than the normal range for subjects in the placebo and xanomeline low 
dose group.  Subjects in the xanomeline treatment groups had statistically significantly 
more values above the normal range than subjects in the placebo group for both urea 
nitrogen and eosinophils.  There was a statistically significant association between 
clinically significant changes from the previous visit and treatment group for aspartate 
aminotransferase and eosinophils.  Shifts from baseline for eosinophils were statistically 
significant with both xanomeline treatment groups showing more changes from normal to 
above normal than the placebo group.  There was no significant association with 
treatment group in the Hy’s law analysis examining shifts in liver function tests between
baseline values and values while on treatment.
There were only minor changes from baseline in vital signs and weight at Week 24.
