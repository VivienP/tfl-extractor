Table 14-5.02 
Incidence of Treatment Emergent Serious Adverse Events by Treatment Group 
 
 
Note:  Treatment emergent events are defined as events which start on or after the start of treatment. 
Note:  Adverse events are coded using MedDRA. 
Note:  Percentages are based on the number of subjects in the safety population within each treatment 
group. 
Note:  P-values are based on Fisher's Exact test for the comparison of placebo versus each active treatment 
group.  An asterisk is appended to p-values that are less than 0.15. 
Note:  The column [AE] represents the total number of times an event was recorded.
